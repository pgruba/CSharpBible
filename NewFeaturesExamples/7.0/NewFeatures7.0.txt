1. Tupples
2. Pattern matching
3. Async Main method to allow consume async/await instead of DoAsync().GetAwaiter().GetResult();
4. Local Functions - from 7.0 we can declare local function (inside methods) including async 
5. Expression bodied members (can be use for constructor, destructor and in properties as get or set)
6. Throw expression - throw is now expression so we can use with conditional operators, null coalescing operators etc
7. Default literal expressions:
	Insted of writing this:
		Func<string, bool> whereClause = default(Func<string, bool>);
	now we can write it like below:
		Func<string, bool> whereClause = default;
